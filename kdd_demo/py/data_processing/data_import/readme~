			import data
==============================================================
1. run the py files to import data in the directory of *.txt files;

2. delete # symbols to activate some codes;

3. min_activeness = 100 and min_action = 20 maybe not appropriate: in our experiment we found out that fake users has much less than 20 interactions, and much more than 33.2% users had more than 100 tweets; (well, just the result of the sampling, we just assigned the parameters but never proof them)

4. we provide our test data which has already been managed, so if you want to run the data import codes please run on the raw data (*.txt)
